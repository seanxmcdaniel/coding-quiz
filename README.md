# Coding Quiz

For this assignment, I created a Coding Quiz made up of five different questions related to coding. Upon page load, you'll see
a button stating "Start Quiz", and a timer in the top right corner. Clicking that button will prompt a box showing the 
rules for the quiz. You have 60 seconds to complete the quiz, and each incorrect answer deducts 15 seconds from the clock. If 
you run out of time, a "try again" button will pop up and you can go back to the beginnning and try again. At the end of the quiz,
your score will be shown. 

## "Wrong" and "Correct" answers
